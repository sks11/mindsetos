# üîê Admin Setup Guide

## How to Configure Admin Access

### 1. **Add Your Email to Admin List**

Edit `lib/admin.ts` and add your email to the `ADMIN_EMAILS` array:

```typescript
export const ADMIN_EMAILS = [
  'your-email@gmail.com',        // Replace with your actual email
  'admin@mindsetos.com',         // Add more admin emails as needed
  'another-admin@example.com',   // Additional admins
]
```

### 2. **Admin Access Levels**

#### **Development Mode** (Default)
- Admin panel is enabled for development
- Only users in `ADMIN_EMAILS` can see the admin button
- Perfect for testing

#### **Production Mode**
- Admin panel is only enabled if `ADMIN_EMAILS` has entries
- Only whitelisted emails can access admin features
- Secure for production use

### 3. **How to Test Admin Access**

1. **Add your email** to `ADMIN_EMAILS` in `lib/admin.ts`
2. **Login** with that email address
3. **Look for "Admin" button** in the header (only visible to admins)
4. **Click "Admin"** to access the testing panel

### 4. **Admin Features**

The admin panel allows you to:
